# Modcraft App — Project Context for Claude

## What this project is
A single-file HTML quotation management app for **World Class Laminate, Inc. / RTMO Digital School** (interior fit-out / modular furniture company based in the Philippines). No server — the entire app is one file (`index.html`) deployed on **GitHub Pages** and embedded in a **Google Site**. All data persists in **Google Sheets** and **Google Drive** via the Google Sheets API and Drive API using OAuth 2.0.

## Live URLs
- **GitHub repo:** https://github.com/rotaligatos/modcraft-app
- **Live app (GitHub Pages):** https://rotaligatos.github.io/modcraft-app/
- **Google Sheets database:** https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rs79K8wX27lxVRddksNlYwdyesTCOjIhHCqH0jRMV-o
- **Google Drive folder:** The app creates "Modcraft Quotations" in the signed-in user's personal My Drive (NOT the old hardcoded folder `1hK4iox_XmAFWOD-mMGjpEHBENOxJneeB` which was the original broken approach)

## Key files
- `index.html` — the entire app (HTML + CSS + JS, ~9000 lines)
- `server.ps1` — local PowerShell static server (port 8765, serves `quotation_app.html`)
- `preview_server.ps1` — preview server for Claude testing (port 8766, serves `index.html`)
- `.claude/launch.json` — launch configs for both servers
- `WCLI SKU Items with SRP.xlsx` — product price data for import

## Google Sheets structure (SHEETS_ID = `1Rs79K8wX27lxVRddksNlYwdyesTCOjIhHCqH0jRMV-o`)
| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `Quotations` | Index of all quotations (serial, date, client, status, total, etc.) |
| `Quotation State` | Full editable state JSON per quotation, chunked across 10 columns (B–K, 45k chars each) |
| `Clients` | Client directory (name, biz name, contact, segment, etc.) |
| `Settings` | App config — one CONFIG row with JSON for cost factors + scheduling + terms |
| `User Roles` | User email → role + company assignment |
| `Activity log` | Audit trail |
| `Quotation Items` | Line items detail |

## Google Drive structure (Shared/Team Drive under wcli-it-admin)
- **Shared folder ID:** `1hK4iox_XmAFWOD-mMGjpEHBENOxJneeB` (Team Drive — all users have Editor access)
- Stored in Settings sheet as `sharedDriveFolderId` and loaded at login for all users
- All Drive API calls use `supportsAllDrives=true` (required for Team Drive folders — missing this causes "File not found" errors on writes)
```
Modcraft Quotations/          ← Team Drive folder under wcli-it-admin
  QT-260601-4083/             ← one subfolder per quotation serial
    QT-260601-4083 — Client — state.json     ← full data backup
    QT-260601-4083 — Client — Draft.html
    QT-260601-4083 — Client — Final Quotation.html
  QT-260602-9378/
    ...
```

## Google OAuth
- **Client ID:** `605710112392-vgvmr9e66b8himis6ka118cdq5er6393.apps.googleusercontent.com`
- **Scopes:** `spreadsheets`, `drive`, `userinfo.email`, `userinfo.profile`
- **Token expiry:** tracked via `gTokenExpiry`; auto-refreshed silently via `gRefreshToken()` using `prompt:''`
- **In iframe (Google Sites):** popup sign-in works; silent refresh does NOT (browsers block it in iframes); when token expires inside embed, the session-expired banner appears and user re-auths via popup

## Architecture decisions (WHY things are the way they are)

### Why state is in Sheets, not Drive
Original code saved quotation state as JSON files to a hardcoded Drive folder. This failed silently because:
1. The folder belonged to a different account (users couldn't write to it)
2. Drive API requires more auth complexity than Sheets
Solution: `saveQuotationJson()` now saves to the `Quotation State` sheet tab (primary), with a Drive backup in the per-quotation subfolder (secondary/nice-to-have).

### Why tokens auto-refresh
Google OAuth tokens expire after ~1 hour. Without refresh, saves silently hit 401 errors that the old code treated as success — data appeared to save but nothing was written. The `gApiFetch()` wrapper handles this transparently.

### Why demo data was removed from failure paths
`gLoadClients()` and the Projects directory previously fell back to demo/sample data whenever a read failed. This made it look like "all my saved data is gone" when really the read had just failed due to an expired token.

## Critical variables (globals in index.html)

## Key functions to know
```javascript
gApiFetch(url, opts)           // auth-aware fetch: auto-refreshes token, retries on 401
gRefreshToken()                // silent token refresh (prompt:'')
gOnSessionExpired()            // shows the red "session expired" banner
ensureDriveFolder()            // finds/creates "Modcraft Quotations" in user's My Drive
ensureQuotationFolder(s, pid)  // finds/creates QT-XXXXXX-XXXX subfolder
saveQuotationJson(cb)          // saves state to Quotation State sheet + Drive backup
loadQuotationJson(serial, cb)  // loads state from Quotation State sheet
gSaveAppSettings()             // saves CF + MOB_LOCATIONS + scheduling/terms to Settings tab
gLoadAppSettings(cb)           // restores settings from Settings tab (called at login)
verifyDatabaseConnection()     // checks Quotations, Clients, Quotation State tabs
setupMissingSheetTabs()        // creates missing sheet tabs with correct headers
```

## Serial number format
`QT-YYMMDD-RRRR` where RRRR is a 4-digit random number.
Option serials: `QT-YYMMDD-RRRR-N` (N = option number 1, 2, ...).
The dedup regex is `/^(QT-\d{6}-\d{4})/` — extracts the base serial, stripping the option suffix but NOT the 4-digit random part (old bug: `/-\d+$/` stripped it all, collapsing same-date quotations).

## Companies supported
```javascript
var COMPANIES = [
  'World Class Laminate, Inc.',
  'Module Systems and Services, Inc.',
  'Cebu World Laminate, Inc.'
];
```
Each user is assigned a company in the `User Roles` sheet (column D). The quotation print header reflects the user's assigned company. Each company can have its own logo uploaded.

## User roles
Admin → Manager → Supervisor → Approver → Encoder → Staff → Viewer
- Certain actions require a **Manager or Supervisor PIN**: non-VAT treatment, revision of approved quotation, unlock, holiday premium override, custom cost factor override
- **Device binding** (optional, toggled in Settings → Security): users can be restricted to a registered device ID
- **Approval delegation**: a user can delegate approvals to another user
- Feature access (`ACC_KEYS`): `Dashboard`, `KPI`, `Reports`, `Profit/Revenue`, `Quotations`, `Analytics`, `Approvals`, `Schedule` — each toggleable per user in the Users sheet

## Full feature list (built across all sessions)

### Quotation page (Stage 1 & Stage 2)
- **Two-stage workflow:** Stage 1 = Initial Quotation, Stage 2 = Final Quotation
- **Two pricing modes per area:** Services mode (select from service catalog) vs BOM/Cutting-list mode (full Bill of Materials)
- **Areas:** multiple areas per quotation, each with its own line items
- **Quotation options/variants:** multiple options per quotation (e.g. Option 1: Laminate, Option 2: Solid Surface); each option has its own snapshot; one can be "approved" for Stage 2
- **Cost components:** fabrication, installation, assembly, mobilization (by location), bond & insurance, site visit fee, cutting list charge, design charge, QA/QC
- **VAT treatment:** default 12% inclusive; Non-VAT requires Manager/Supervisor PIN approval; logged
- **Discount:** requires Manager/Supervisor PIN
- **Holiday/weekend premium:** auto-detected from PH holiday list; requires PIN to approve
- **Custom cost factor override:** per-quotation override of the global CF rates (requires Supervisor/Manager)
- **Lock & Send:** Stage 1 locked quotation → generates PDF/HTML, can email client; Stage 2 same
- **Revision:** approved quotation can be revised (requires PIN); new serial created, old marked superseded
- **Quotation serial** tracks `Revised from: QT-XXXXXX` if applicable
- **Client section:** linked client (B2B/B2C), business name, contact, address, service type
- **Print/PDF:** html2pdf.js for PDF download; by-area and by-item layouts; company logo in header

### BOM / Cutting-list mode
- **Cabinet types:** 13 types with templates (materials, hardware, services pre-filled from price DB)
- **Materials, Hardware, Services, Outsource** sections per BOM item
- **Price database dropdowns:** live lookup from the Price Database Google Sheet
- **EBT (Edge Banding Type):** codes like `4s`, `1s`, `2s` define which edges get banding; auto-calculates linear metres; deduct thickness configurable
- **Outsource markup, contingency, buffer** rates separate from standard CF

### Price Database (Settings → Price Database tab)
- **Separate Google Sheet** (`PRICE_DB_ID = '1t7ND6N6uwJtkm7VWziUUf7gbqcn_sOXHhde0ZFeqVpY'`)
- Tabs: `Services`, `Materials`, `Hardware`, `CabinetTemplates`
- Import from Excel; initialize with defaults
- Cabinet template rows load automatically when BOM cabinet type changes

### Designers Support (Production AI page)
- Upload shop drawings / cutting lists → Claude AI extracts components, services, BOM
- **Claude API key** stored in Google Sheets `User Roles` sheet header row column R (shared across all users)
- Per-area grouping; editable reflect summary; "Reflect to quotation" pushes AI result into quotation
- EBT legend and cabinet rules configurable in Settings → Designers Support
- `prodSettings` object (saved to `localStorage` as `mc_prod`): `claudeKey`, `kerf`, `aiEnabled`, `shopDrawing`, `cabinetRules`

### Clients page
- Full client directory loaded from `Clients` Sheets tab
- **B2B segments:** General Contractors, Architects & Interior Designers, Real Estate Developers, Commercial, Hotels & Hospitality
- **B2C segments:** Homeowners, Condo Owners, First-time Homebuyers
- Client search/autocomplete on quotation form; auto-creates client record from quotation info
- Transaction history per client (pulled from Quotations tab)

### Schedule page
- Gantt chart (full year) and Calendar (month) views
- Philippine holidays highlighted in red
- Fabrication and installation dates with workday calculations

### Reports page
- Dashboard KPIs: total revenue, active quotations, conversion rate, etc.
- Analytics: by segment, by status, by month, by agent
- Custom Report Export: Excel (.xlsx) and PowerPoint (.pptx) via SheetJS / PptxGenJS

### Users page (Admin only)
- Full CRUD against `User Roles` Sheets tab
- Assign role, company, active status, device ID, feature access, delegation
- Device binding: enforce user must sign in from registered device

### Settings page sub-tabs
| Sub-tab | What it controls |
|---------|-----------------|
| Company & DB | Company branding, DB connection test, "Create missing tabs" |
| Network & Deployment | LAN/ngrok/GitHub Pages/VPN setup guide |
| Security | Device binding toggle |
| Scheduling | Fab units/day, install teams/day, holiday premium % |
| Cost factors | All CF rates (markup, buffer, VAT, contingencies, labor, etc.) + MOB_LOCATIONS |
| Validity & Terms | Quotation validity days, payment terms text, T&C text |
| Carcass pricing | Per-unit carcass cost table |
| Services | Labor service catalog |
| Price Database | Connect/initialize the Price DB Google Sheet |
| Designers Support | Claude API key, kerf, EBT/cabinet rules |

### Notifications system
- In-app notifications (`NOTIFS` array) for: client updates, approvals, follow-up alerts
- Quotation lifecycle: Active (0–25d) → Follow-up alert (day 25) → Inactive (day 30) → Archived (day 35)

### AI Help chat
- Built-in help chatbot on the Help tab with hardcoded Q&A for common workflows

## Settings persistence
Settings are saved when the user clicks **"Save settings"** in the Settings page header.
They are loaded automatically at login (`gShowApp()` → `gLoadAppSettings()`).
Covers: CF (all cost factors), MOB_LOCATIONS, scheduling fields, validity, payment terms, T&C.

## What was built in the earlier "Quotation-app" session (session local_e47522e1)
These were all built before the current session — do NOT re-implement or overwrite:
1. **Core quotation form** — areas, items, qty, cost calculations, two-stage workflow
2. **BOM/Cutting-list mode** — cabinet types, materials/hardware/services/outsource per item, price DB dropdowns
3. **EBT (Edge Banding Type)** — code system (`4s`, `1s`, `2s`, etc.), LM calculation, deduct logic
14. **Price Database** — separate Google Sheet, import from Excel, initialize with defaults
5. **Cost factors (CF)** — markup, buffer, VAT, contingencies, labor cost, capacity, etc.
6. **Mobilization costs (MOB_LOCATIONS)** — by location, workers × days calculation
7. **Quotation options/variants** — multiple options per quotation, snapshot on lock
8. **Lock & Send** — Stage 1 and Stage 2 lock, PDF via html2pdf.js, email workflow
9. **Revision workflow** — PIN-gated, new serial, tracks `qRevisedFrom`
10. **Designers Support (Production AI)** — Claude API, shop drawing upload, reflect to quotation
11. **Users page** — Google Sheets CRUD, role assignment, device binding, feature access, delegation
12. **Client directory** — B2B/B2C segments, autocomplete, transaction history
13. **Schedule** — Gantt + Calendar, PH holidays, workday calculations
14. **Reports** — KPIs, analytics, Excel + PowerPoint export
15. **Google Login + Sheets integration** — OAuth, role check, company assignment
16. **PIN approval modals** — Manager/Supervisor PIN for VAT, unlock, revision, premium
17. **Notifications system** — quotation lifecycle alerts, follow-up reminders
18. **Multi-company support** — per-user company, per-company logos, header branding
19. **AI Help chat** — hardcoded Q&A in Help tab
20. **Network & Deployment guide** — LAN/ngrok/GitHub Pages instructions in Settings

## What was fixed in the session that created this file
1. **Project list dedup bug** — same-date quotations all collapsed into one entry
2. **Clients tab auto-creation** — `gSaveClient` now creates the tab if it doesn't exist
3. **Quotation State tab** — replaced Drive JSON saves with Sheets-based chunked storage
4. **Token expiry** — `gApiFetch` auto-refreshes, session banner on failure
5. **Demo data masking** — failed reads no longer replace real data with demo
6. **Settings persistence** — CF + terms now saved to/loaded from Sheets
7. **Google Sites embed** — popup OAuth works inside the iframe; fallback to new tab if popup blocked
8. **Drive folder structure** — per-quotation subfolders with HTML + JSON backup
9. **Race condition** — in-flight promise guards on folder creation
10. **False "Database save failed" on lock** — was Drive HTML save failing; now silent (data in Sheets is safe)

## Known remaining areas to watch
- **Carcass pricing tab** in Settings — not yet verified as persisted through `gSaveAppSettings`
- **Drive saves in Google Sites embed** — token refresh via `prompt:''` is blocked in iframes; users must re-auth via banner ~hourly
- **First-time setup flow** — user needs to: sign in → Settings → Test connection → Create missing tabs → Save settings

## Development workflow
```bash
# Local preview (Claude testing)
# Uses preview_server.ps1 on port 8766, serves index.html

# Deploy
git add index.html
git commit -m "description"
git push origin main
# GitHub Pages auto-deploys to https://rotaligatos.github.io/modcraft-app/
# Takes ~90 seconds; poll with: curl -s URL | grep -q "some-new-string"
```

## Testing approach
- Use the `preview_start` / `preview_eval` MCP tools to load `index.html` locally
- Mock `window.gApiFetch`, `window.sheetsGet/Append/Update`, `window.gToken` for unit tests
- Always verify no console errors after changes
- Always commit + push after verified changes
